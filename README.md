# Hi I'm Akos! üëã

üíº I am a fullstack developer! I currently work as a fulltime employee, and also code a lot in my free time.

üíª I ‚ù§Ô∏è learning all kinds of modern technologies, and problem solving in general! I am also very interested in algorithms and optimizations.

üßπ I am very fond of clean architectures and clean code. I strive to write better code every day.

üß™ I invest time into creating CI/CD pipelines, automation, and testing.

üöÄ I enjoy both server and client side coding.

## Profile üë®‚ÄçüöÄ

I really like Angular on the frontend, because of its architecture. The modular design sits really well with me,
and it enforces a lot of good coding principles. I have tried a few backend frameworks, and I quite like .Net, but
if I want a nodejs backend, then NestJs has definitely been my favourite for its strong similarity with Angular. I am
also very interested in the cloud, and CI/CD pipelines.

On a personal note, I love dogs. I enjoy doing all kinds of sports, mainly football. I also find it important
to spend time with friends.

I love to code, and I try to always work on some project. My projects are kept in GitHub, and are available there. Below is a list of most of my projects in GitHub.
